            <p class="text">

                In 2019, I watched a movie that blew my mind.

                <br><br>

                It was about a japanese guy called Akio Sakurai,
                who became obsessed with the legendary guitar player from Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page.

                <br><br>

                I don't mean <em>he-bought-all-the-vinyls</em> obsessed, oh no.

                <br><br>

                We're talking about someone who started dressing up like him.

                <br><br>

                The resemblance was so powerful, that he became known as Mr Jimmy. 

                <br><br>

                During this project, I had a sudden realization: 

                I too, became obsessed. With him.

            <p class="research-story">
               I wanted to tell his story as an experience, which is why I decided to build a website
               that not only looked like a guitar, but that could also be played like one.

               The site is as minimalistic as possible, and allows the user to
